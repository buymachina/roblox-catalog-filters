## buymachina/roblox-catalog-filters

Roblox's catalog sucks shit, enough for someone who rarely uses the platform (me) to notice. In response, I built this. Using this with uBlock Origin (or anything out there that supports its filter list system, if that exists), will completely remove filtered listings from the catalog, allowing you to find what you are looking for faster, and reducing the amount of income of people capitalizing on some of the more malicious listings.

### What will be filtered?

These points cover everything that would cause a group, user, term, or specific item to be filtered, to the best of my ability.

------------


##### Main list:
- **Bigotry/Hate Speech**
Yeah. This typa stuff makes its way onto the catalog somehow. Anything that appears disrespectful towards any race, sexuality, gender, or other marginalized group is filtered. Note that when it is possible, context taken from other products sold by an individual or group is taken into account. Using something I have actually seen on the catalog as an example; in isolation, a listing for a kippah head accessory appears perfectly fine, but viewing the store page of the group that uploaded it, listings for "large nose" accessories are seen, revealing the actual intent of the creator.

- **Generally Objectible Content**
Stuff you just straight up don't wanna see. I saw a dirty diaper item on the catalog and it caused me to create this project. That falls under this category.

- **"Bypassed"/Intentionally Disruptive Items**
Big, annoying, shit.

- **Items Capitalizing on Current Events**
The world is hell, let's not bring it into the kids block game, okay?

------------


##### Separate lists (each category has its own file) (big bias influence past this point):
- **"Speech Bubble" Items**
Most of the time formatted as texting bubbles, generally just don't look good.

- **The Funny**
Sixty Seven Labubu Steal My Brainrot Whatever The Fuck They Say. I want it outta my sight man im trying to buy clothes for my avatar on this game i am not the target demographic of. This list is very broad.

- **Bootleg Accessories**
These are accessories created as direct copies of existing, typically more expensive ones. You don't need that korblox right leg. You can think of a better outfit, you have the creativity.

- **"Character Bodysuits"**
Wear the skin of your favorite cartoon character or real life person today!

- **Joke Emotes**
Sometimes these are actually kinda funny, but as the goal of this project is to bring the catalog to a state where it can be used to actually make an outfit, they gotta go.

- **Poor Attempts At Deception**
Fake verification marks, counterfit ingame stats, and other items to, at least some extent, create a false display of having what you do not.

- **Low Effort**
You know it when you see it.
